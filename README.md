This Rust project provides a starting point for machine learning on pharmacogenetics data. It includes:

- A CSV data loader function that reads multi-column pharmacogenetic training data with genetic markers and clinical outcome labels.
- Conversion into numeric feature arrays and label vectors using ndarray for efficient numerical computing.
- A simple linear regression model training stub demonstrating how to fit model weights to data.
- Focus on clean, idiomatic Rust code utilizing robust crates like csv and ndarray.
- Easily extendable for more complex logistic regression or machine learning workflows.
- Ideal for bioinformaticians and Rust developers interested in applying ML techniques to genetic and clinical data. The project serves as a base for building personalized medicine models and pharmacogenetic predictors.
